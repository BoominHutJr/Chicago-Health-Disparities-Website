# Current website files #
## COM 424 - Final project ##
In this directory, you'll find a folder for each page on the current website. You do not have to retain this information structure. As we discussed in class, you should redesign the site based on the common criteria that we came up with (you can find them in the assignment description).

I've done my best to create usable HTML from the current WordPress site by stripping the classes and id values associated with CSS on that site. However, you should feel free to modify the HTML so long as you keep it standards compliant and well formed.

If you have any questions, let me know.
